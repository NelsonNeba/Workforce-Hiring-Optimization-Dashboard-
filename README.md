## üìä Data Sources & Model

The dashboard integrates data from three primary sources, meticulously cleaned and transformed to ensure data integrity and analytical readiness.

| Dataset      | Key Fields Included                                       | Description                                                                  |
| :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Employee** | `Employee ID`, `Employee Name`, `Job Title`, `Age`, `Home City`, `Home State`  | Detailed demographic and professional information for each employee.         |
| **Store** | `store_id`, `employees`, `store_size`, `city`, `state`, `region`  | Information on retail store locations, sizes, and current employee counts.   |
| **Hiring** | `hiring_id`, `hiring_date`, `joining_date`, `hiring_mode`, `ctc`, `interviews`, `relocation_cost`, `hiring_cost` | Comprehensive records of the recruitment process, including costs and timelines. |

A robust data model was established in Power BI, connecting these tables to enable cross-dataset analysis and dynamic filtering.

## üîç Key Insights & Recommendations

The dashboard uncovers critical patterns and provides actionable intelligence:

* **Hiring Cost Efficiency:**
    * The **average hiring cost is approximately $600**.
    * **Newspaper advertising emerges as the most cost-efficient hiring mode**, suggesting a focus for future recruitment drives.
    * Relocation costs show a notable impact on overall hiring expenditure, particularly for certain job titles (e.g., Managers, Finance Executives).

* **Time-to-Join Analysis:**
    * The **average time-to-join ranges between 46 and 54 days**.
    * Hires sourced through **Search Engine channels tend to have longer time-to-join durations**, indicating areas for process optimization or targeted engagement.

* **Employee Demographics & Distribution:**
    * A significant portion of the workforce comprises a **younger demographic**, particularly in Sales and Finance roles, which can inform talent development and retention strategies.
    * Employee concentrations are highest in **California and New York**, aligning with major operational hubs.
    * The average employee age across all stores and roles is visible, allowing for demographic segmentation analysis. 

* **Store Staffing & Regional Imbalances:**
    * Analysis reveals that some **Medium-sized stores are currently overstaffed**, while specific **Large stores are understaffed** in certain regions based on optimal employee-to-store size ratios. This points to opportunities for strategic reallocation.
    * The **West region incurs the highest average hiring costs**, necessitating a review of regional recruitment practices or compensation structures.
    * The dashboard dynamically shows total employees per region and per store size, facilitating quick identification of staffing disparities.
* **Compensation (CTC) Patterns:**
    * **Managerial hires consistently exhibit the highest average CTC (~$70K)**, especially when recruited via Newspaper channels. This insights helps in budgeting and competitive compensation analysis.
    * Observed discrepancies in CTC for similar job roles highlight potential misalignments in compensation strategies, suggesting a need for standardized pay scales or performance-based incentives.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack & Key Learnings

This project leveraged a robust set of Microsoft Power BI features and data analysis techniques:

* **Data Extraction & Transformation (ETL):** Utilized **Power Query** to connect to disparate CSV sources, perform data cleaning (handling missing values, standardizing dates, removing duplicates), and transform raw data into a star schema model.
* **Data Modeling:** Established a highly efficient and scalable **star schema data model** with clear relationships between Employee, Store, and Hiring tables, crucial for accurate cross-filter interactions.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Developed complex DAX measures for key metrics such as:
    * `Total Hires`, `Total Hiring Cost`, `Avg Days to Join`, `Average CTC`.
    * `Total Employees in Stores`, `Average Employee Age`, `Total Stores`, `Avg Employees per Store`.
    * `Total Relocation Cost`, `Hires with Relocation`, `Avg Relocation Cost`, `Avg Interviews per Hire`.
    * Calculated `Correlation HiringCost_CTC` to quantify the relationship between these two critical financial metrics.
* **Advanced Visualizations:** Implemented a variety of visual types to tell the data story effectively:
    * **KPI Cards:** For at-a-glance performance monitoring with Year-over-Year (YoY) growth indicators.
    * **Stacked Area Charts:** To visualize trends over time for total hires, average CTC, and relocation costs.
    * **Clustered Bar Charts:** For comparing metrics across regions, hiring modes, and age groups.
    * **Donut Charts:** To illustrate employee distribution by store size.
    * **Scatter Charts:** To explore correlations, e.g., `Hiring Cost` vs. `CTC`.
    * **Interactive Tables:** For detailed breakdowns of recent hires and relocated employees.
* **Interactivity & User Experience:**
    * **Slicers:** Dynamic slicers for filtering by `Region`, `Job Title`, `Hiring Mode`, `Year`, `Month`, `Home State`, and `Store Size`, enabling granular analysis.
    * **Dynamic Titles & Tooltips:** Enhanced user experience by providing context-sensitive information.
    * **Hidden Slicer Panels:** Implemented advanced bookmarking and button actions to create a clean, modern user interface with expandable slicer panels for improved dashboard aesthetics and usability.
